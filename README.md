# data_assem
A "backup" of scripts that traverse all the data dealing with CT images and XPCI images, performs image registration, and saves the registered impact, all with proper flat-field corrections and normalizations.

It can be run as follows. Note it can only be run on Ryan's workstation !

```python
python traverse.py
python registrator.py
```
